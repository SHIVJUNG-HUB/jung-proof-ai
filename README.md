### 💡 Community-Driven Disaster Early Warning System for Nepal

Jung Proof AI is an **innovative, human-centered AI system** designed to **save lives before disasters strike**.  
It combines **machine learning, satellite data, and community observations** to predict **flood and landslide risks at a hyper-local level** in Nepal. 🌄🌧️

## ⚠️ Why Jung Proof AI?

Nepal is one of the **most disaster-prone countries** in the world.  
Every year, floods and landslides destroy:

- 🏠 Homes  
- 🛣 Roads  
- 🌳 Forests  
- 💰 Livelihoods  

Local communities often notice **early warning signs** like:  

- Cracks in the slope  
- Muddy springs  
- Unusual river behavior  

…but these signals are **rarely captured by technology**. Jung Proof AI changes that.  

> “We listen to **both nature and people**.” 💡👥
